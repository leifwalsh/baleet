baleet
======

not to be confused with [balete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balete)

SYNOPSIS
--------

"Securely" deletes all of its arguments.  It writes over each of them 8 times
(in fact, slightly over), then unlinks them.

USAGE
-----

    % baleet secure files /go/here

BUGS
----

There are none.  Really, try to find one.  I'll bake you some cookies if you
find one.

TODO
----

* Find a better way to test secure deletion.
* Find a better use of my time.

AUTHORS
-------

* Leif Walsh <leif.walsh@gmail.com>
